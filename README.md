An action RPG like Diablo

I just started with the development. It's the first time I'm using SFML and also I'm not very experienced in programming in C++ for bigger projects. I just wanted to start once a little project in my free time, because at the moment I'm working in the network support. So it's just I don't loose my coding abilities and to learn something more about programming in general and programming games in specific.


Things I'd like to implement at the moment:
- The V8 Scripting Engine
